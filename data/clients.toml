  quote = "This is going to be long but worth it-I have been messaging Kristy for about three months making sure everything was set for my son and daughters joint birthday party. It was a special day because their dad had been deployed and missed a lot so we were celebrating a little late. Communication was wonderful until the day before I needed the cakes I sent a message and said I needed them at 10:30 on Sunday which was the next day. Come to find out, I gave her the wrong date 3 months earlier and never realized it. Instead of Sunday I told her Monday. Yet, she stayed up, made the cakes I was asking for and they turned out absolutely beautiful and tasted amazing. There are not many people that would help you out when YOU make a mistake but she did and never once said anything negative, just that she was so glad she could help and that my children had their cakes. Not only are her cakes wonderfully decorated and taste amazing, she's also a wonderful person. What more could you want from someone you're doing business with? Thank you again for everything!"
